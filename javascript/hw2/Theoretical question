Functions are created by user. If we want to do same operations many times in our code, then we use functions to save space and time. They work as system built-in functions(alert(), prompt(), confirm()). When we call them they do their tasks. Some functions need arguments, while others don't. We pass arguments to the function, function does some operations through these arguments and then returns us some value or operation. Some functions (boolean) checks whether something true or false and return 1 and 0 respectively.
